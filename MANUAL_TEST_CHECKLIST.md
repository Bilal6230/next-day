# Next Day — Manual test checklist

Use this after configuring `.env` and deploying `firestore.rules`.

## Environment & launch

- [ ] App shows **Firebase setup required** when `.env` is missing or incomplete
- [ ] App loads splash/loading, then auth or main shell when configured
- [ ] Dark theme appears on splash, auth, and main screens

## Authentication

- [ ] **Register** — validation errors for empty/invalid email, short password, mismatched passwords
- [ ] **Register** — successful signup navigates to main tabs
- [ ] Firestore document created at `users/{uid}` with `email`, `displayName`, timestamps
- [ ] **Login** — validation for empty fields
- [ ] **Login** — wrong password shows friendly error (not raw Firebase code)
- [ ] **Login** — correct credentials open main app
- [ ] **Forgot password** — invalid email validation
- [ ] **Forgot password** — success message after submit (no email enumeration leak in copy)
- [ ] **Sign out** (More tab) — returns to login

## Navigation

- [ ] Auth stack: Login ↔ Register ↔ Forgot password
- [ ] Bottom tabs visible when signed in: Today, Tasks, Money, Growth, More
- [ ] Placeholder tabs show title and subtitle
- [ ] Today tab shows all five dashboard cards with empty states

## Today dashboard

- [ ] Greeting uses display name (or email prefix)
- [ ] Cards: Today's Focus, Tasks Due Today, Bills Due Soon, Habit Progress, Quick Note
- [ ] Each card shows empty state copy
- [ ] Scroll works on smaller screens

## Security (Firebase Console)

- [ ] Unauthenticated Firestore read/write denied
- [ ] User A cannot read/write `users/{userB_uid}`
- [ ] User A can read/write own `users/{userA_uid}` document

## Regression

- [ ] No hardcoded user IDs in source
- [ ] `.env` not tracked by git
- [ ] App runs after cold start with persisted session (AsyncStorage auth persistence)
